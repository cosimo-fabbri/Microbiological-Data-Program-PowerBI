# Microbiological-Data-Program-PowerBI

The Microbiological Data Program (MDP), launched in 2001, was designed to monitor the presence of harmful bacteria in fresh produce across the US. By collecting and testing samples from over 600 distribution sites, the program focused on detecting contaminants like Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella, and E. coli in fresh fruits and vegetables. Positive test results prompted immediate notification to the FDA and further communication with the CDC and State Health Departments to prevent foodborne outbreaks. 

This project was undertaken independently of my work and academic studies, driven by my personal interest in the subject matter. My goal was to enhance my proficiency in PowerBI by analyzing a topic I am deeply interested in.

# Project Workflow:

1. Data Acquisition: Downloaded public datasets from the USDA official website (https://www.ams.usda.gov/datasets/mdp/mdp-program-data-and-reports)

2. Data Cleaning and Integration: Utilized PowerQuery to clean the data and imported it into PowerBI. This also involved merging two main tables—a summary of the collected  results and several demographic tables—into a single consolidated table.

3. Initial Reporting: Created an overview report in PowerBI to illustrate the origin and sources of the sampled produce analyzed. Also created a dropdown menu to filter data by month, type of detected bacteria (first 3 dashboards) and state where the sample was collected (last 2 dashboards).

4. Focused Analysis on Infected Produce: Developed two report pages that detail the infected samples. These pages examine which commodities were affected, their origins, temporal trends, types of packaging, and the retail environments where they were sold.

5. Bacterial Analysis: Constructed two additional report pages dedicated to analyzing the types of bacteria found and their distribution concerning the previously mentioned factors.

In order to quickly visualize my work you can look at the .pdf file with static visualizations present in the repository; alternatively, feel free to download the .pbix file and run it on PowerBI Desktop to delve into the interactive dashboards i developed.
